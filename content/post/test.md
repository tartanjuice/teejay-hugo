Here is a test of a new post.

I used `hugo new post/test.md` in Terminal to create the file. Then edited the markdown in VS Code. 

Now what's left is:
- figure out how to upload/include photos
- figure out how to push to GitHub and/or Netlify
- figure out how to post remotely (from my phone or at work)
